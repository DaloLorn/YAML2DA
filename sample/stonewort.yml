# NEVER EVER EDIT THIS FIELD: This tells YAML2DA this is a BGCraft herb.
yamlType: bgcraft_herbs

# Sequential list of files whose fields should be used as default values.
# The final file will be generated as follows:
# 1. Take all the fields defined in the first file specified in `inherits`.
# n. Take all the fields defined in the nth file specified in `inherits`, and
# use them to overwrite any existing values in those fields.
# n+1. Take all the fields defined in this file, and use them to overwrite
# any existing values in those fields.
#
# For instance, although we're inheriting from `ethereal_herb`,
# which has an `ethereal` value of 1, we've defined `ethereal`
# as `null` in this file, so the generated row will have a value of "****".
inherits:
  - ethereal_herb

# Optional identifier used instead of the filename when:
# - Resolving inheritance (e.g. this file would now be imported as `stwort` instead of `stonewort`)
# NOTE: Filenames are fully lowercased when generating implicit identifiers.
# The only way to use uppercase characters in a file's identifier is to
# explicitly set this field.
identifier: stwort

# This is the 0-indexed ID of the row this file will be exported to.
# Files without an `id` field will not be exported into the final 2DA.
# Gaps between IDs will be filled with empty padding rows, to maintain
# table integrity between exports.
#
# IMPORTANT: This ID must be unique across all files of this type! YAML2DA will
# refuse to pack a project with redundant row IDs.
id: 11

# All of the below fields correspond exactly to a column in bgcraft_herbs.2da.
label: Stonewort
# Except this one: This one maps to the `Identifier` column to avoid conflict with YAML2DA.

msgSuccess: "Survival: Success - Digging a small hole into the ground and around
  the stonewort, you are able to protect the rhizomes and to collect a whole
  plant."
msgFailCheck: "Survival: Failure - Digging around the stonewort seems to further
  damage the plant. You can't isolate a good plant with fresh and whole rhizomes
  here."
msgCooldown: The holes in the ground and the area seem quite disturbed after
  recent harvest attempts. More time might be needed to inspect the area and the
  plants.

# These variants are nonsense, but they adequately demonstrate
# the variant system. ID 13 will contain a duplicate of Stonewort with the 
# label `Mywort`, and ID 9 will contain a duplicate of Mywort with the harvest 
# group `exwort`.
#
# A few reminders in case you haven't read the 0.4.0 changelog:
# - Variants do not have identifiers, so they can't be inherited from by
#   other files.
# - Variants cannot use the `inherits` field, so the can't inherit data from
#   other files.

  - id: 13
