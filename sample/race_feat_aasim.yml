# List of files whose `levels` fields should be merged into this one
# before exporting this file into a 2DA.
imports:
  - universal_feats

# Optional identifier used instead of the filename when:
# - Resolving imports (e.g. this file would now be imported as `race_feat_aasimar` instead of `race_feat_aasim`)
# - Naming generated 2DAs when exporting the project (this file will now export as `race_feat_aasimar.2da`)
# NOTE: Filenames are fully lowercased when generating implicit identifiers.
# The only way to use uppercase characters in a file's identifier is to
# explicitly set this field.
identifier: race_feat_aasimar

# If absent or set to false, no 2DAs will be generated for this file
# when exporting a project. A 2DA can still be generated by instructing YAML2DA
# to pack this file directly.

# An unordered set of feat labels and their corresponding IDs,
# describing all the feats to be added by this race (aside from those
# imported from another file).
